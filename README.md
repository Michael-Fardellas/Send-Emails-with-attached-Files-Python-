It also uses tkinter and a library called email.message, but both of them are preinstalled with python.

## How to run the programm ðŸ’» ##

- An IDE(integrated development environment). I would recommend something like [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or something simple like
[Sublime Text](sublimetext.com)

- A python version above 3.6. You can install Python [here](python.org)

## How to make it an EXE ðŸ§® ##

If you want an icon for the exe file you need to make an .ico file. To do that just take the picture that you want and make it an ico file.

Then you need to run this command 

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

```
pyinstaller.exe --onefile --icon=myicon.ico main.py
```

Then your exe should be in the dist folder
